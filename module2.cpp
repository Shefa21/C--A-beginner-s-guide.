3. What values can a bool variable have?
4. What is the long integer data type?
5. What escape sequence produces a tab? What escape sequence rings the bell?
6. A string is surrounded by double quotes. True or false?
7. What are the hexadecimal digits?
8. Show the general form for initializing a variable when it is declared.
9. What does the % do? Can it be used on floating-point values?
10. Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator.
11. Which of the following are logical operators in C++?
a. &&
b. ##
c. ||
d. $$
e. !
12. How can
x = x + 12;
be rewritten?
13. What is a cast?
14. Write a program that finds all of the prime numbers between 1 and 100
  1. The C++ integer types are
The type char can also be used as an integer type.
2. 12.2 is type double.
3. A bool variable can be either true or false.
4. The long integer type is long int, or just long.
5. The \t sequence represents a tab. The \b rings the bell.
6. True, a string is surrounded by double quotes.
7. The hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

8. To initialize a variable, use this general form:
type var = value;
9. The % is the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of an integer division. It cannot be used
on floating-point values.
10. When the increment operator precedes its operand, C++ will perform the corresponding
operation prior to obtaining the operand's value for use by the rest of the expression. If the
operator follows its operand, then C++ will obtain the operand's value before incrementing.
11. A, C, and E
12. x += 12;
13. A cast is an explicit type conversio
