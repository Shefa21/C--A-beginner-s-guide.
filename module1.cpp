module 1
  1. It has been said that C++ sits at the center of the modern programming universe. Explain this
statement.
2. A C++ compiler produces object code that is directly executed by the computer. True or false?
3. What are the three main principles of object-oriented programming?
4. Where do C++ programs begin execution?
5. What is a header?
6. What is <iostream>? What does the following code do?
#include <iostream>
7. What is a namespace?
8. What is a variable?
9. Which of the following variable names is/are invalid?
41 C++ A Beginner’s Guide by Herbert Schildt
a. count
b. _count
c. count27
d. 67count
e. if
10. How do you create a single-line comment? How do you create a multiline comment?
11. Show the general form of the if statement. Show the general form of the for loop.
12. How do you create a block of code?
13. The moon’s gravity is about 17 percent that of Earth’s. Write a program that displays a table that
shows Earth pounds and their equivalent moon weight. Have the table run from 1 to 100 pounds.
Output a newline every 25 pounds.
14. A year on Jupiter (the time it takes for Jupiter to make one full circuit around the Sun) takes about
12 Earth years. Write a program that converts Jovian years to Earth years. Have the user specify the
number of Jovian years. Allow fractional years.
15. When a function is called, what happens to program control?
16. Write a program that averages the absolute value of five values entered by the user. Display the
result
1. C++ is at the center of modern programming because it was derived from C and is the parent of Java
and C#. These are the four most important programming languages.
2. True, a C++ compiler produces code that can be directly executed by the computer.
3. Encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance are the three guiding principles of OOP.
4. C++ programs begin execution at main( ).
5. A header contains information used by the program.
6. <iostream> is the header the supports I/O. The statement includes the <iostream> header in a
program.
7. A namespace is a declarative region in which various program elements can be placed. Elements
declared in one namespace are separate from elements declared in another.
8. A variable is a named memory location. The contents of a variable can be changed during the
execution of a program.
9. The invalid variables are d and e. Variable names cannot begin with a digit or be the same as a C++
keyword.
10. A single-line comment begins with // and ends at the end of the line. A multiline comment begins
with /* and ends with */.
11. The general form of the if:
if(condition) statement;
The general form of the for:
for(initialization; condition; increment) statement;
12. A block of code is started with a { and ended with a }.
13. // Show a table of Earth to Moon weights.
2 C++ A Beginner’s Guide by Herbert Schildt
14. // Convert Jovian years to Earth years.
15. When a function is called, program control transfers to that function.
16. // Average the absolute values of 5 number
